🧬 Ovarian Cyst Predictor & Treatment Recommendation System

This AI-powered tool helps clinicians and patients make informed decisions about ovarian cysts. It predicts cyst behavior and recommends treatment pathways based on clinical data and evidence-based guidelines.

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Predict the likelihood of cyst growth or malignancy using ML.
- Recommend treatment plans: observation, medication, or surgery.
- Export downloadable Excel reports with prediction confidence and clinical flags.
- Future features: real-time medication & surgical tool tracking, cost estimations, and financing support.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python (Pandas, scikit-learn, NumPy)
- ExcelWriter for data export
- Git & GitHub for version control
- (Planned) Streamlit / Flask for deployment

## 📁 Project Structure


## 📊 Sample Output

| Patient ID | Risk Score | Recommended Management | Clinical Flag |
|------------|------------|-------------------------|----------------|
| OC-1001    | 0.82       | Surgery                 | High Risk      |
| OC-1002    | 0.34       | Observation             | Low Risk       |

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Input patient data: age, menopausal status, cyst size, symptoms, etc.
2. The model classifies risk and outputs a prediction.
3. Recommender system suggests next clinical steps.
4. Results are saved to Excel with risk flags and confidence scores.

## 📈 Roadmap

- [x] Predict cyst behavior
- [x] Generate downloadable treatment report
- [ ] Add tracking of medication and surgical tool availability
- [ ] Include cost estimations and financing options
- [ ] Build interactive web-based interface (Streamlit/Flask)
